 	<p>This is the first paragraph. All the text on this page is inside a div id=box element.</p>
	<p id="offset">This second paragraph is position:relative; with top: 100px; and left: 500px; -- Therefore it is offset +100 pixels from the top and +500 pixels from the left. Notice that there is a gap between the first and third paragraph that is <em>equal</em> to the amount of space this 2nd paragraph would take up in the normal flow.</p>
	<p>Here's a third paragraph.</p>
